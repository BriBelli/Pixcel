 * Pixcel is allowed to call, each with the env key that unlocks it and the live docs the Model
 * agent researches. That's the floor Brian wants deterministic ("just give it the APIs"), and
 * nothing more.
 *
 * EVERYTHING ABOVE THIS LINE IS AUTONOMOUS — which models a provider offers, their versions,
 * capabilities, prices, reference limits, prompt formulas, and the per-model "tricks" (burst,
 * character sheets, motion transfer) are the Model agent's self-refreshing responsibility. They
 * are NEVER hardcoded as truth. Hardcoding the model layer is precisely how photolif died: a
 * static, daily-stale rating file that was wrong the moment it was written and didn't know it.
 *
 * So: give the agent the APIs (this file). It owns the rest (the registry, refreshed against
 * `docsUrl` / `modelsEndpoint` on a TTL — see `staleness.ts`).
 *
 * NO KEYS / NO SPEND live here — this is pure data. `envKey` is a POINTER; only the provider
 * adapter (behind the executor seam) ever reads the actual secret.
