/**
 * SUCCESSOR DETECTION — noticing that the model you route to has been superseded.
 *
 * The refresh pass answers "does this model still exist?" and "are there ids we have never seen?".
 * Neither question catches the thing that actually degrades output quality: a model we curated is
 * still live, still working, still confirmed — and a NEWER VERSION of it shipped beside it.
 *
 * That failure has now happened four times in this project. FLUX sat two generations stale. Recraft
 * V3 was routed to while V4.1 had been the API default for months. Happy Horse was seeded at 1.0 with
 * 1.1 live. And Seedance 2.0 was in the registry while 2.5 — double the clip length — was one page
 * away. Every one was caught by a person reading a docs site, which is precisely the labour this
 * system exists to eliminate.
 *
 * The reason discovery misses it: `bytedance/seedance-2.5/...` is simply an unfamiliar id. Nothing
 * connects it to `bytedance/seedance-2.0/...`, so it lands as a candidate among dozens rather than as
 * "the model you are using, but newer".
 *
 * So: parse ids into (family, version) and compare. Pure + deterministic — this is a string question,
 * and answering it with an LLM call would be both slower and less reliable.
