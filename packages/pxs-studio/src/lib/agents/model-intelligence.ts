/**
 * THE MODEL-INTELLIGENCE WORKFLOW — the ONE daily pass that keeps the registry true.
 *
 * Brian's rule, verbatim: "A single workflow can check every API is available, and then do a research
 * lookup." There used to be three separately-triggered processes (existence refresh, capability
 * research, maintenance) with four endpoints — this file is their single front door. The pieces stay
 * pure + individually tested; this is the ORCHESTRATION, in the only order that makes sense:
 *
 *   1. AVAILABILITY — hit every provider's live listing: which models still exist, which are new
 *      (discoveries), which vanished (ghosts). Free + deterministic. (engine/model-refresh)
 *   2. JUDGMENT — research fresh discoveries into routable cards; age/retire ghosts on repeated-miss
 *      evidence. Runs right after availability so a discovery is researched the same pass it's found.
 *      (model-maintenance)
 *   3. CAPABILITIES — re-verify the LIVE catalog's stale records against provider docs (Tavily + the
 *      research brain) and persist sourced corrections as seed_override cards. This is what fixes
 *      "FLUX = 1 reference"-style lies without a human. (capability-refresh)
 *   4. DOCTRINE — fetch each model's PINNED official docs in FULL and (re-)distill its prompt
 *      doctrine when the docs changed. The knowledge layer: real formulas, principles, task
 *      patterns — what the Prompt Guide and the craft score stand on. (doctrine-refresh)
 *   5. VIDEO DOCTRINE — the same pass over the video models, under the VIDEO craft lens (camera,
 *      motion, duration, synced audio) and the video task vocabulary. Same engine, not a fork: two
 *      copies of a self-maintaining loop is how the copies drift apart.
 *   6. SUCCESSION — for every model we route to, IMAGE AND VIDEO, ask the provider whether a newer
 *      version of it exists. The other steps answer "does this still work?"; none of them answer
 *      "has this been superseded?", and that is the question whose absence let FLUX sit two
 *      generations stale, Recraft route to V3 while V4.1 was the API default, Happy Horse seed at 1.0
 *      with 1.1 live, and Seedance run at 2.0 while 2.5 shipped. Every one was caught by a person
 *      reading a docs site — exactly the work this system exists to do.
 *
 * BOUNDED BY DEFAULT. A pass used to run every step over every model with no cap: one POST ground
 * for an hour, held a request open long after the caller had given up, and starved the app's own
 * requests (observed 2026-08-25 — an abandoned curl kept the whole registry churning). Work is now
 * capped per call and STAGGERS across calls via the TTL, so any single trigger returns promptly and
 * repeated triggers finish the catalog. `force` exists for a deliberate, operator-initiated rebuild.
 *
 * Two entries:
 *   · runModelIntelligence      — a bounded pass (POST /api/models/maintain; cron or manual).
 *   · runModelIntelligenceIfDue — TTL-gated, fire-and-forget from the image-agent hot path: on most
 *     turns nothing is due → a couple of cheap DB reads, zero network. This is what makes the DAILY
 *     cycle real even with no cron: the first turn after each TTL window pays for the refresh.
