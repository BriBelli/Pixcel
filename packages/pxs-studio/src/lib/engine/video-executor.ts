/**
 * THE VIDEO EXECUTION SEAM — the video twin of `executor.ts`, deliberately NOT a reuse of it.
 *
 * Why a separate seam: the image executor is image-shaped in ways that matter. It assumes a call that
 * returns in seconds and hands back finished pixels. Video is a JOB: you submit, it queues, it runs
 * for minutes, and you poll until a clip exists. It also carries parameters images have no concept of
 * — duration, frame rate, resolution tiers, whether audio is generated in the same pass, a start
 * frame, an end frame. Forcing that through `GenRequest` would mean lying about all of it, and the
 * UI could never show honest progress because there'd be nothing to report between "sent" and "done".
 *
 * So the contract is a STREAM OF JOB EVENTS. An adapter yields `queued` the moment the provider
 * accepts the job, then `progress` as it advances, then `clip` per delivered video. That is what lets
 * a minute-long render feel alive instead of frozen — the same reason the image fan streams tiles.
 *
 * Registration mirrors the image side exactly (`registerVideoExecutor` / `getVideoExecutor`), so the
 * two stacks stay recognisably the same shape without sharing a type that fits neither.
